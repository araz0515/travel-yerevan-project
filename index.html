        <h2>Why Yerevan?</h2>
        <h1>Yerevan, a jewel for travel, food and wine</h1>
        <p>
          Yerevan, Armenia, is generally a safe, friendly and vibrant city with
          attractive architecture and rich history. Nicknamed the ‘pink city’
          because of the color of volcanic tufa rock from which many buildings
          are constructed, this is a city where strolling allows you to see
          plenty.
